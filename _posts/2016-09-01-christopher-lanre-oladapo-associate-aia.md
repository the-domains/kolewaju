Christopher Lanre Oladapo's journey started in Lagos, Nigeria. There he was introduced to architecture in its simplest form, driven by function: the need for shelter divorced from the environment and disconnected from its local aesthetics. This drove his curiosity, questioning the fundamental meaning of architecture and the role architects play in the larger community. The search for answers brought him to the United Stated where he faced even more questions and complexities of what it means to be an architect. After receiving his Master of Architecture from Savannah College of Art of Design in 2012, Chris moved to Los Angeles, California where he interned for mid size commercial firms. Now Chris is an integral part of the team at Osborne architects. He is actively pursuing Licensure, in the hopes of adding to the knowledge base of architecture as a profession, instrument for living and an art form.
